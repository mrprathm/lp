first do login in both virtual machines 

then use following command ->  ifconfig


to check if already there is some file in VM use -> ls 

now create one file in VM1  -> touch abc.txt
then add content -> nano abc.txt 
 
after adding content use crtl+s to save our file .
then we have to click crtl+x 

you should use cat command to know then content is there inside or not 

Now we have to transfer the file -> 
   scp abc.txt login_username@IP_of_VM2:/home/login_username
